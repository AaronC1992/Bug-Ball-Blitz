## 🎲 Game Rules

1. **Match Duration**: Customizable (1-5 minutes) or first to reach goal target (3-15 goals)
2. **Scoring**: Kick the ball into opponent's goal
3. **Goals**: Located on left and right sides of the field
4. **Physics**: Realistic ball physics with gravity, bounce, and momentum
5. **Directional Kicks**: Control ball direction based on movement and positioning
6. **Reset**: Ball and players reset after each goal with 3-second countdown
7. **Weather Effects**: Rain, snow, and wind affect ball physics dynamically

## 🧠 AI Behavior

### Difficulty Levels

- **Easy (😊)**: Slow reactions, poor prediction, 30% accuracy
- **Medium (😐)**: Moderate skill, 60% accuracy
- **Hard (😠)**: Fast reactions, 85% accuracy
- **Pro (😈)**: Near-perfect play, 95% accuracy

### 2v1 AI Teamwork

In Tower Campaign levels 5-8, two AI opponents coordinate:
- One attacks aggressively toward the ball
- One defends near the goal
- Dynamic role switching based on positioning

## 💰 Monetization (AdMob Integration Scaffold)

The project includes a lightweight ads abstraction (`ads.js`) that provides a unified API for:
- Interstitial ads (shown after match end, with a cooldown to avoid spamming)
- Banner placeholder (`#adBanner`) rendered on the match result screen
- Rewarded ad stub (API present; add a button to trigger and grant rewards)

### Your AdMob IDs
App ID:
```
ca-app-pub-6064374775404365~2828970201
```
Interstitial (Transitions):
```
ca-app-pub-6064374775404365/3897960551
```

These are configured in `ensureAds()` inside `main.js`. Web builds only show placeholders; real ads require a native wrapper.

### Enabling Real Ads (Android/iOS)
1. Wrap the project using Capacitor (recommended) or Cordova.
2. Install an AdMob plugin:
    - Capacitor: `@capacitor-community/admob`
    - Cordova: `admob-plus-cordova`
3. Configure your App ID:
    - Android `AndroidManifest.xml`:
       ```xml
       <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID" android:value="ca-app-pub-6064374775404365~2828970201" />
       ```
    - iOS `Info.plist`:
       ```xml
       <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
       <string>ca-app-pub-6064374775404365~2828970201</string>
       ```
4. Replace placeholder logic in `ads.js` with plugin calls (load/show interstitial & rewarded) per your chosen plugin’s README.
5. Build and test on a real device (use test ads; never click live ads during development).

### Rewarded Flow (Next Step)
Add a button (e.g., on the match end screen or styles shop):
```js
game.ads.showRewarded(() => {
   // Grant reward (extra cosmetics currency, bonus XP, etc.)
});
```

### Consent & Privacy
For GDPR/CCPA regions:
1. Show a consent modal on first launch.
2. Store choice in `localStorage` (e.g., `adConsent=true`).
3. Only call `ensureAds()` after consent is granted.

### Frequency Capping
`AdsManager` includes an interstitial cooldown (default 120s). Adjust via `interstitialCooldownSeconds` when constructing.


## 🎨 Artwork

All game assets are created as inline SVG graphics:
- 5 unique bug characters with animations
- 3 distinct arena backgrounds
- Soccer ball with pentagon pattern
- UI elements and menus
- Goal posts and nets

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Bugs

Edit `bugs.js` and add a new bug object with:
- Unique ID and name
- Stats (speed, jump, power, size)
- SVG artwork
- Color theme

### Creating New Arenas

Edit `arenas.js` and define:
- Ground and sky colors
- Visual effects (grass, dirt, etc.)
- Background gradient

### Adjusting Difficulty

Edit `ai.js` difficulty parameters:
- `reactionTime`: AI response delay
- `predictionAccuracy`: Ball trajectory prediction
- `jumpTiming`: Jump decision accuracy
- `aggressiveness`: Attack vs. defend balance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Load
- Ensure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify all files are in the same directory

### Controls Not Working
- Click on the game canvas to focus it
- Check if another window has keyboard focus
- On mobile, ensure touch is enabled

### Progress Not Saving
- Check localStorage is enabled in browser
- Don't use incognito/private mode
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

## 📝 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Online multiplayer with matchmaking
- More bug characters and special abilities
- Power-ups and special moves during matches
- Tournament mode with brackets
- Replay system with highlights
- Background music and enhanced sound effects
- Advanced particle effects
- Character customization shop
- Daily challenges and events
