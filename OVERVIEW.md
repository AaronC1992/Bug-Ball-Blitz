## 🧠 AI Intelligence System

### Single AI (Levels 1-4, Quick Play)

**Decision Making:**
1. Calculate ball trajectory prediction
2. Determine intercept position
3. Move toward target with error margin
4. Jump timing based on ball height
5. Apply difficulty-based accuracy

**Difficulty Parameters:**

| Difficulty | Reaction Time | Prediction | Jump Timing | Max Speed |
|------------|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Easy       | 30 frames     | 30%        | 40%         | 60%       |
| Medium     | 20 frames     | 60%        | 60%         | 80%       |
| Hard       | 10 frames     | 85%        | 80%         | 100%      |
| Pro        | 5 frames      | 95%        | 95%         | 100%      |

### Multi-AI (Levels 5-8)

**Team Coordination:**
- Dynamic role assignment (attacker/defender)
- Distance-based role switching
- Coordinated positioning
- Shared ball awareness

**Behaviors:**
- **Attacker:** Aggressively pursue ball, frequent jumping
- **Defender:** Position between ball and goal, reactive defense

## 🔬 Physics Engine Specifications

### Constants
- **Gravity:** 0.6 (pixels per frame²)
- **Ground Position:** 70% of canvas height
- **Friction:** 0.95 multiplier per frame
- **Bounce Damping:** 0.7 multiplier on collision
- **Goal Width:** 100 pixels
- **Goal Height:** 120 pixels

### Ball Physics
1. Apply gravity to vertical velocity
2. Update position based on velocity
3. Apply friction to horizontal velocity
4. Check ground collision (bounce with damping)
5. Check wall collisions (reverse with damping)
6. Check ceiling collision
7. Stop micro-bounces (threshold: 1 pixel/frame)

### Player Movement
1. Apply gravity
2. Update position
3. Apply ground friction
4. Check ground contact (set isGrounded flag)
5. Constrain to canvas boundaries
6. Process movement input (left/right)
7. Process jump input (only when grounded)

### Collision Detection
- Circle-to-circle distance check (ball vs. player)
- Minimum distance: ball radius + player radius
- Separation algorithm (push apart)
- Velocity transfer (kick physics)
- Kick power scales with bug stats

- **Score Limit:** 5 goals
- **Draw Possible:** Yes (if time expires with tied score)

### Bug Stat Impact

**Speed:** Affects horizontal movement velocity
- Range: 0.5x to 1.0x base speed

- Shadow rendering with ellipse primitives
- No unnecessary redraws

### Physics Optimizations
- Fixed timestep (requestAnimationFrame)
- Early exit collision checks
- Constrained simulation area
